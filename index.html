<h3>An update.</h3>

<p>Given what the world has been thrown into, this is no longer the right time for a new fitness business to be getting off the ground.</p>

<p>So for the moment, I'm putting the launch of Space on the back burner until we're out the other side of the disruption, and the business climate becomes clearer.</p>

<p>Space is an experience that I'm still very passionate about being able to offer, but we'll just have to wait a little longer than planned.</p>

<p>The membership presale is closing for now, and a refund is on the way to all of you that had made a purchase or donation. Presale memberships will be made available again as soon as we're back in action.</p>

<p>I believe exercise is monumentally important for mental health, especially in a time of such uncertainty, and with many self-isolating. So with Space on pause, I'll be turning my attention to finding ways to connect people with group exercise from their homes, to try and limit the disruption that COVID-19 is causing in this part of peoples lives.</p>


<p>With very best wishes,</p>
